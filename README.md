## My process

### Built with

- VueJs and Javascript
- Vuex state management
- Jest and Cypress
- Bulma Css

### What I learned

The goal is to redo development in the Vuejs environment and test these good practices. Create an application and connect to an API to use server resources. You have to put in place clean code and set up unit tests and manage end-to-end tests.
